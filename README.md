# Chrome Extension: PCAP to HC22000 Converter
This is a (WIP) simple chrome extension to convert `.pcap` files generated by Wireshark to `.hc22000` format that can be used with Hashcat.

## WASM

```
cargo install wasm-pack
```
Build the WebAssembly module using `wasm-pack`:

cd ./wasm
wasm-pack build --target web
```

-   Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right corner.
-   Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `chrome_pcap_to_hc22000` directory.

## How to use:
After following the installation instructions above, click on the extension icon and select a `.pcap` file from system storage. 
Download the converted file to your desired location.
